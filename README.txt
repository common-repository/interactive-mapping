Adds the ability to create an interactive map using Open Street Map and adding markers with text

## Description

The Interactive Mapping plugin creates two new menus in the admin sidebar which will allow you to:
* Add a map using co-ordinates from Open Street Map
* Set a zoom level
* Create a marker
* Add the marker to any or all maps created
* Uses short codes so maps can be added to any page or post
* Uses category slug so you can create a map of a town say Lostwithiel and then create a category called Lostwithiel and only add markers using that category

In order to feature a marker on a certain map we have created a shortcode. There are instances where the marker might not show because of a wrong ID or category slug.
